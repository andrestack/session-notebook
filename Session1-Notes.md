**What is Git?**

a version control system to make projects with >1 person (in different places) more trackable. Makes sure to preserve all changes in the code base, even when done simultaneousy. You can also add other types of data, not only code.

**GitHub** - website

**repository** - nests projects and their different components (files); downside → you don’t really delete a change since the repository keeps the older versions. You need to manually do one by one.

**markdown** - syntax that allows wirtting formatted text that can be stored in plain text.

**commit** - snapshot (save file) of your changes: group them together, name them clearly (use imperative: add, change …)

_A well-crafted Git commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to other developers working on that project, and indeed, to your future self._

## Some hilarious commit msgs that are actually real:

"Deleted some shit and added the good stuff"
"Checkout completely set up, I hope this shit still works lord"
"Saving progresss before I potentially fuck up eveything"
